Data Split and Processing Consistency Diagram:
- Training set: 14258 patients (16300 records)
- Validation set: 1782 patients (2036 records)
- Test set: 1783 patients (2055 records)

Processing workflow:
1. All transformations/imputations/selectors fit only on training set
2. Only transform validation and test sets
3. Maintain data leakage prevention
